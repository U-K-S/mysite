DBMS Project(Including frontend-{ JS, html, CSS}, backend-{ PHP, Nodejs} and database-{ MySQL})

This project's scope is to develop and deploy an end-to-end application for an online retail store like Big Bazaar.
This application will serve the needs of both customers and retailers. This will help the retailers maintain the inventory
through database systems like products, quantity, price, expiration date, and other attributes of items in the inventory. 
The application will make it easy for users to navigate through items in the inventory and process their queries,
such as adding to a cart, managing the user's profile, using discount coupons, and confirming the order. Apart from this,
the database system will serve the purpose of secure login, handling payments, generating invoices, and storing information
about employees, orders, and customers.
